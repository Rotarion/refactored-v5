## Dependency Map

The new dependency direction is:

`hotkeys -> workflows -> domain + adapters`

`workflows -> domain`

`workflows -> adapters`

`adapters` do not call `workflows`

`domain` does not call `adapters`

Concrete module roles:

| Module | Primary dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| `workflows/batch_run.ahk` | `domain/batch_rules.ahk`, `domain/message_templates.ahk`, `domain/date_rules.ahk`, `adapters/quo_adapter.ahk`, `adapters/tag_selector_adapter.ahk` |
| `workflows/message_schedule.ahk` | `domain/message_templates.ahk`, `domain/date_rules.ahk`, `adapters/quo_adapter.ahk` |
| `workflows/prospect_fill.ahk` | `domain/lead_parser.ahk`, `adapters/browser_focus_adapter.ahk`, `adapters/crm_adapter.ahk` |
| `workflows/crm_activity.ahk` | `domain/date_rules.ahk`, `domain/message_templates.ahk`, `adapters/crm_adapter.ahk` |
| `adapters/tag_selector_adapter.ahk` | `adapters/devtools_bridge.ahk`, `adapters/quo_adapter.ahk`, `adapters/clipboard_adapter.ahk` |
| `domain/lead_parser.ahk` | `domain/lead_normalizer.ahk`, `domain/batch_rules.ahk` |

## Extraction Map

| Legacy responsibility | New destination |
| --- | --- |
| INI-backed settings and runtime bootstrap | `main.ahk`, `config/*.ini`, `logs/run_state.json` |
| Pure lead cleanup, names, address, DOB, phone, email | `domain/lead_normalizer.ahk` |
| Lead parsing from labeled/raw/grid input | `domain/lead_parser.ahk` |
| Batch row parsing and vehicle/tag holder shaping | `domain/batch_rules.ahk` |
| Pricing resolution | `domain/pricing_rules.ahk` |
| Quote/follow-up message composition | `domain/message_templates.ahk` |
| Business-day and rotation math | `domain/date_rules.ahk` |
| Clipboard pacing and low-level paste helpers | `adapters/clipboard_adapter.ahk` |
| Browser activation | `adapters/browser_focus_adapter.ahk` |
| DevTools JS execution and CRM DOM helpers | `adapters/devtools_bridge.ahk` |
| Quo composer/new-chat/schedule primitives | `adapters/quo_adapter.ahk` |
| CRM form fill and appointment UI sequences | `adapters/crm_adapter.ahk` |
| Active tag selector flow | `adapters/tag_selector_adapter.ahk` + `assets/js/tag_selector.js` |

## Dead Or Duplicate Candidates

Evidence-based candidates from `Final_V5.5.ahk`:

| Candidate | Evidence | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SendSelectedBatch(picker)` | defined at line 1203, no active caller in V5.5 | removed from refactor, replaced by active `SendSelectedBatchV2` path |
| `ClickAddNewAppointmentJS()` | defined at line 1477, no active caller in V5.5 | removed from refactor |
| `tag_activation.js` | variable declared at line 45, no later reads in V5.5 | not migrated into new assets tree |
| Stable vs fast batch engines | duplicated logic at lines 3293-3387 and 3439-3530 | consolidated into one batch engine with mode flag |
| Stable vs fast builder scheduling | duplicated logic at lines 3243-3287 and 3388-3433 | consolidated into one scheduling workflow with mode flag |
| Multiple historical monoliths | `Final V5.ahk`, `Final_V5.2.ahk`, `Final_V5.3.ahk`, `Final_V5.4.ahk`, `Final_V5.5.ahk` | left untouched for comparison, not imported into refactor |
